# Search-Favorite-TV-Shows

In this project I create a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows a User to search for a Television Show, and see all results that match the submitted query. To implement this project, I used AngularJS as front-end framework, and Node.js as back-end technology. All API calls must be routed through the Node.js application.

Upon entering a search query, the application query the TVMaze API.The search results include an image representative of the series, as well as an overall summary of the television show.
